You are an expert PostgreSQL and Supabase architect.
I need a complete setup for a Barber Shop application (ISAM Barber).

Please generate a single SQL script to:

1.  **Cleanup**: Drop existing tables to ensure a clean slate (`bookings`, `services`, `staff`, `products`, `orders`, `gallery`, `reviews`, `settings`).
2.  **Schema**: Create these tables with UUIDs, correct types, and relationships.
    - `services` (id, name, price, category...)
    - `bookings` (id, service_id FK, date, time, customer info...)
    - `products` (id, name, price, stock...)
    - `orders` (id, total, status...)
    - `gallery` (id, url, type...)
    - `staff` (id, name, role...)
    - `reviews` (id, rating 1-5, comment...)
    - `settings` (id, shop_open bool...)
3.  **Security**: Enable RLS on all tables. Create generous policies for now (public read/write) to ensure the app works immediately without authentication, as we are in development mode.
4.  **Indexes**: Add indexes on `booking_date` and `service_id` for performance.
5.  **Data**: Insert default settings row.

The goal is to have a working backend immediately after running this script.
